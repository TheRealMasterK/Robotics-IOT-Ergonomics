Install the Arduino VS Code Extension: Open VS Code and navigate to the Extensions pane (you can use the shortcut Cmd + Shift + X). Search for "Arduino" and install the official Arduino extension by Microsoft.
Configure the Arduino Extension:
Open the Command Palette (Cmd + Shift + P) and type "Arduino", then select "Arduino: Board Config" to set up your board. You should select "Arduino/Genuino Uno" for the Arduino Uno.
Next, select "Arduino: Select Serial Port" and choose the serial port that your Arduino is connected to. If you're unsure, you can check this in the Arduino IDE under "Tools > Port".
Write and Verify Your Code: Write your Arduino code in a new VS Code file and save it with a .ino extension. To verify your code (i.e., check it for errors), you can use the "Arduino: Verify" command in the Command Palette.
Upload Your Code: To upload your code to the Arduino, use the "Arduino: Upload" command in the Command Palette.
